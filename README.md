# hello-world

Hello,
I'm Tori. I have been a stay-at home mom for a few years now.
I've been searching for jobs, I've been an online college student, and I love to talk about the good and bad of motherhood.
This site is where I plan to talk about various "mom" things.

I may post about work-at-home opportunities, I may post about my kids...
Hell, I may even post some recipes!
